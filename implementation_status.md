## Current Focus
**Active Phase**: Phase 1 - Project Setup & Foundation
**Next Milestone**: Complete development environment setup
**Estimated Completion**: 13 days total

## Technical Decisions Made
1. **React + Phaser Integration**: Using official Phaser 3 + React template approach
2. **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for complex game state management
3. **Performance**: Object pooling and optimized rendering for mobile
4. **Architecture**: Separation of UI (React) and game logic (Phaser)

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: React and Phaser integration (well-documented patterns)
- **Medium Risk**: Performance optimization for mobile devices
- **Medium Risk**: Complex match-3 algorithm implementation
- **Low Risk**: UI/UX implementation with React

## Success Metrics
- Smooth 60fps gameplay on mobile devices
- Responsive design across all screen sizes
- Complete match-3 functionality with power-ups
- Engaging user experience with animations and effects
- Scalable architecture for future features
